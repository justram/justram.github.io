I'm Jheng-Hong (Matt) Yang, a Ph.D. student at the prestigious David R. Cheriton School of Computer Science, University of Waterloo. My research revolves around cutting-edge topics such as neural ranking models, sparse & dense retrieval models, and multimodal information retrieval, all under the expert guidance of Professor [Jimmy Lin](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~jimmylin/index.html).

Before embarking on my Ph.D. journey, I had the incredible opportunity to work as a research assistant at the Research Center for Information Technology Innovation at Academia Sinica. During my time there, I contributed to significant projects in the Computational Finance and Data Analytics and Computational Linguistics and Information Processing ([CFDA & CLIP](https://cfda.csie.org)) Labs, focusing on the development of music recommender systems and time-series modeling for credit analysis.

If you'd like to connect with me or have any insights to share, don't hesitate to reach out through my email: jheng-hong.yang [at] uwaterloo [dot] ca. I value any valuable feedback, whether positive or constructive, and I am genuinely grateful for the opportunity to learn and grow.
