I'm Jheng-Hong (Matt) Yang, a Ph.D. candidate at the renowned David R. Cheriton School of Computer Science at the University of Waterloo, where I specialize in neural ranking models, multimodal information retrieval, and both sparse and dense retrieval methods. My research is advised by Professor [Jimmy Lin](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~jimmylin/index.html), contributing to innovative projects that advance the boundaries of information retrieval and data systems.

Prior to my Ph.D. journey, I was a research assistant at Academia Sinicaâ€™s Research Center for Information Technology Innovation. There, I contributed to pioneering projects within the [CFDA&CLIP](https://cfda.csie.org) Labs, focusing on recommender systems and time-series modeling in credit risk analysis.

Feel free to reach out at jheng-hong.yang [at] uwaterloo [dot] ca with insights or collaboration ideas. I value all constructive feedback and am always eager to learn from diverse perspectives.
